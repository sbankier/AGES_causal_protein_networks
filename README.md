## AGES causal protein networks

This repository is linked to the research work "Circulating causal protein networks linked to future risk of myocardial infarction". In this project, causal networks of human serum proteins were reconstructed using data from the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study (AGES), a prospective population-based study of 7,523 serum proteins measured in 5,376 older adults.

This repository contains code used for the reconstruction of these networks, data processing, and downstream analysis. A link to the preprint for this work can be found [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.07.25321789v1).
